# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning
The book "혼자 공부하는 머신러닝 + 딥러닝" builds upon the fundamental concepts I have learned through "처음 만나는 AI 수학 with 파이썬", with an emphasis on practical implementation using the scikit-learn library. While some content overlaps, this book delves deeper into machine learning and deep learning concepts, providing a more hands-on approach with examples.

Key highlights of the book include:

1. Utilization of scikit-learn Library: The incorporation of the scikit-learn library streamlines the learning process, making it more accessible and easier to apply machine learning algorithms.
2. Explanation of Various Concepts: The book covers a wide range of machine learning and deep learning concepts, with a focus on practical implementation. Specific algorithms such as logistic regression, grid search, random forest, and clustering algorithms are explained and demonstrated with examples.
3. Upcoming Chapters: The book is structured to cover topics such as deep learning and neural networks for image and text analysis in subsequent chapters, providing a comprehensive understanding of advanced concepts in the field.

Overall, "혼자 공부하는 머신러닝 + 딥러닝" serves as a valuable resource for individuals looking to delve deeper into machine learning and deep learning, offering a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application using the scikit-learn library.
