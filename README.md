# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning
!!! Still in progress !!!
Contents of the book '혼자 공부하는 머신러닝 + 딥러닝'.
Many contents overlaps with '처음 만나는 AI 수학 with 파이썬', but this book uses scikit-learn library which made the progress way easier.
The book explains various concepts of machine learning and deep learning with examples.
Specific algorithm models are used; namely, logistic regression, grid search, random forest, clustering algorithm, etc.
Chapters that are yet to be covered consists of deep learning, neural network for image and text analyzation.
